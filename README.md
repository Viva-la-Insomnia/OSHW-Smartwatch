Features of the project: 
 - EFM32 low-power microcontroller
 - Lithium battery-powered with charge over USB and battery gauging
 - Bluetooth Low-Energy interface
 - Inertial Measurement Unit (Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer)
 - Sharp low-power memory display
 - Separate I2C EEPROM memory (up to 1MB in the current iteration)(flash in the final version)
 - Planned password manager functionality with EFM32 hardware encryption

Current state of project: We have assembled a prototype and are debugging the software
